# cat_vs_dog_classification

Project Overview

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify images of cats and dogs. The primary objective is to train a neural network to accurately distinguish between these two categories using a labeled dataset of images. The project applies deep learning techniques with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve high classification accuracy.
